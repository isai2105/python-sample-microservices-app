####### TRICK 1: USE OF "brew tap"
###
##
# When I ran:
>> brew install mongodb-community 
it failed with:
"Warning: No available formula with the name "mongodb-community". Did you mean mongodb-atlas-cli?"

#So I had to execute the following command... which basically add the Mongo repository to brew.. allowing it access to artifacts that are not on the
#original brew repository
>> brew tap mongodb/brew && brew install mongodb-community
